# Numerical-Algorithm-

Four Algorithms exist this repository. All algorithm created by separate separate function. By this project, we can analysis root and error. (This project created by MATHLAB. So, this project can not run by GNU Octave for some syntax errors. In all program file, if comment out all comment lines and and comment the previous comment bottom line, this project can be work in GNU Octave.)
